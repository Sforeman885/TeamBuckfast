Two scripts; one creates a folder $1 in team/folders/$1 with a file $2 within
Continue if the folder already exists; cancel if the file also exists
Second script creates n files where n is a command line argument
If a file or folder already exists, the script must overwrite it. (Bonus if 
you delete all files previously created) ie delete the directory first 
Usage: ./create [n] 
mkdirplus
createfiles
